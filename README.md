# Property-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Data mining is now commonly applied in the real estate market. Data mining's ability to extract relevant 
knowledge from raw data makes it very useful to predict house prices, key housing attributes, and many more. Research 
has stated that the fluctuations in house prices are often a concern for house owners and the real estate market. 

A survey of literature is carried out to analyze the relevant attributes and the most efficient models to forecast the house prices. 
The findings of this analysis verified the use of the Linear Regression using OLS . 

Moreover, our findings also suggest that locational attributes and 
structural attributes are prominent factors in predicting house prices. This study will be of tremendous benefit, 
especially to housing developers and researchers, to ascertain the most significant attributes to determine house prices 
and to acknowledge the best machine learning model to be used to conduct a study in this field.
